    <div class="col-md-6"><p>In 1968, Lakes Entrance was a beautiful place to live for Raymond Friend. The sleepy fishing village of 1800 people had been home to Raymond and his beloved wife, Mary, for seventeen years. It was a perfect place to raise their three children in what youngest son Simon recalls as “a happy place with a lot of freedom.” Working as a fisherman with his brother Peter, Raymond was always a dreamer. A copy of Time Magazine in one hand, a gummy shark in the other.

</p>In March of 1968, Raymond’s life took an unexpected turn. After 16 years of fishing in Lakes Entrance, Ray saw an opportunity when oil and gas exploration came to Australia. The Yanks were in town. He took the mast out of his prized fishing boat, the Queen Mab, and converted it into a supplies boat, travelling to the exploration vessels in Bass Straight.

Ray was hired by an American company called J R Ingram as the person responsible for coordinating their operations out of Lakes Entrance. The local fisherman replaced an American man called Frank Curry and was much more adept at working with the local people. In fact, he hired over 1700 people in his career and the people of Lakes “remain grateful to this day of Ray Friend,” according to Mick Croucher, one of the people Roy hired under J R Ingrams.

<p/>His journey to Jakarta stemmed from an offer to run the McDermott office in Indonesia from Englishman Eric Selley, who worked offshore for construction company McDermott International. McDermott had bought J R Ingram in 1970, and after a two month period running the office earlier that year, Ray was appointed as the manager for the construction company in Southeast Asia in 1970. He accepted his appointment on the non-negotiable condition Mary would experience this new adventure by his side.

<p/>Indonesia was a whole new world to Lakes Entrance, but Ray and Mary had a ball. Their story is told by some of their close friends and family, including youngest son Simon who lived with them in Jakarta for two years himself.

Bob Hasan was unanimously convicted of losing $244 million US in February 2001 from the Indonesian Government. He was the first and the most prominent Suharto associate who was convicted of fraud after the President resigned in 1998 after 30 years in office.

       Simon Friend says "everything's different" about Indonesia. A perfect example of this is his interaction with General Sumitro, who's wife Lisa was great friends with his mother Mary. When I say wife, she was on of five of Sumitro's wives, so the cultural differences were plain to see for Simon as a teenager. General Sumitro was the deputy chief of Indonesia's Armed Forces in 1965 and was one of President Suharto's main men in the beginning of his presidency. Sumitro fell from grace after being blamed for a violent student riot called the Malari incident, which you will find in the timeline at the bottom of the page.</p>

In 1971 in Indonesia it was manditory for expats to hire at least four Indonesian's in some capacity. The friend family had a chef, a chauffeur, a maid and two people in charge of secuirty. Simon told me that "I still remmeber all of their names and all of their faces. They were very special to the family. They were my good friends, I rememebr Superman and I became best friends."

          <p>Mary became the co-chairman for social welfare for the Women’s International Club in Jakarta. She developed a project in 1976 to help Indonesian’s, especially those living in remote villages who couldn’t walk by raising money for wheelchairs.
  As well as her social justice work, Mary was a tremendous socialite, hosting dinner parties and becoming friends with many of Indonesia’s powerful women. This helped Ray develop relationships with the people that he negotiated big money deals with, establishing a wider business network.

<p>Mr. Siregar worked for Mcdermott, always reporting to Ray. He told me he "looked after passports, took people everywhere and I know about law, I was a lawyer." He spoke about Ray as a boss, as well as the feeling of sadness when he left. He also talked about the politics of Indonesia during the 70s, specifically about General Sumitro, who the Friends knew. He told me that Sumitro's fall from grace was "just politics. He do one thing right, he do wrong. It's just politics." Below he also spoke about the corruption within the government at the time.</p>
